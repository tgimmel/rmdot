This is a small scrip used to remove the dot (period) after the number in a music file.  For 
some reason eMusic new download manger puts a dot at the end of the number which annoys me.
This is a rough little script so use with care.  Adding the -c flag actually make it work.  It's
just a test until then. You feed it a subdirectory name, not filenames.

Have fun!

Usage: rmdot.pl [-c] <path>
       -c to really make the change, otherwise
       just testing.
 
WARNING: Only run once in a subdir or it will clobber
more "dots"!
